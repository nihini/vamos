# Vamos

**Vamos** Let's Go! Long overdue for these Golang snippets, tests, algorithms, learnings, and experimental code to be committed and made public. 

**Vamos** is my open Go playground where I learn, explore frameworks and libraries, test algorithms, do AI experiments, web3 and blockchain development in Go, and store random code snippets.

No guarantees that any of this is working or production ready. For that, these things will first move into a production-ready project, maybe private, maybe public. 

Should you contribute? Yes, send lots of money - ask for wallet address ;-) 

Well, if not money, then time, effort and knowledge. That is what open source is all about. 

Should you comment?  Why not... It might just show your real character, or we can all learn something together. 

Use it... Don't use it...  

Most of the normal open source disclaimers apply here - no guarantees, no warranties, don't use in life-threatening situations, don't use it if you don't know what you are doing, etc. etc.

## Me

I've been coding for the better part of 30 years (C, C++, Basic, Java, C#, Python, Perl, Javascript, TypeScript, Go, Rust and a few other languages). This and some of my other repos that I'll be creating is to start putting things back online - who knows, maybe someone can teach me some more - or I can teach someone or something (AI) a line of code. 

## Features

- Quick play tests and prototypes
- Framework and library experiments
- Algorithm and data structure demos
- AI and machine learning experiments
- Web3 - anything, even smart contracts
- Blockchain
- Self-contained examples
- Stupid stuff
- More stupid code snippets
- Hey, what if I...

## Project Layout

This will change and move and break - no guarantees for anything.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vamos.git
   cd vamos
   ```
2. List available examples:
   ```bash
   ls examples
   ```
3. Run an example (replace `<example>` with an actual folder name). Maybe there is no main.go - just go with the flow and figure it out yourself! 
   ```bash
   go run examples/<example>/main.go
   ```

## Usage

To add your own experiments, fork or clone, add your own code, and commit to your fork. 

1. Create a new folder under `examples/`, e.g. `examples/my-test`
2. Write Go code in `examples/my-test/main.go`
3. Run or build your code:
   ```bash
   go run examples/my-test/main.go
   # or
   go build -o bin/my-test examples/my-test/main.go
   ```

## Contributing

This project is mainly for personal learning, but issues and pull requests are welcome:

- Keep contributions small and focused
- Stick to the rules
- Add or update examples under `examples/`
- Write clear code and include comments where helpful
